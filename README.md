# Awesome Books Project For Microverse By Luzinda Douglas and Daniel Majesty Owiri.

In this project, we will build a basic website that allows users to add/remove books from a list. We will achieve that by using JavaScript objects and arrays. We will also need to dynamically modify the DOM and add basic events.
